# suck-go
Eventually a multi interface binary allowing control of MIIO supporting vacuums (Xiaomi/Roborock robot). Designed to be light on memory + resources. Will *not* provide any deployment files here. They will be in a separate git repo so they can be maintained separately. Will potentially use GoKit to facilitate a nice structure if it's not too heavy on resources.

## Planned supported interfaces
 - Web UI (will likely come first)
 - Rest
 - MQTT
 - GRPC/Protobuf (because why not)
